Session 1
=========

* exponential growth
* reproduction
	-> growth rates and R
	-> NRR



Session 2
=========

* Leslie matrix and projection
	-> general idea
	-> subdiagonal
	-> first row

* recap pre-workshop exercises

* stable population defn and key features

TODO 

- derive entries of leslie matrix



Session 3
=========

* eigendecomposition of the Leslie matrix
	-> stable age distribution
	-> ? damping ratio
	-> ? reproductive value
	-> ? population momentum
