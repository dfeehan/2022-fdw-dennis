## Momentum

Suppose a population's age-specific fertility rates all change by the same factor
to produce a level of fertility that produces a stationary population, i.e. $r = 0$.
Depending on the age structure of the population, it may continue to grow (or decline)
by a fair amount before its size actually stops changing.
This phenomenon is called *momentum*.

In what is called the Keyfitz scenario, age-specific fertility rates are all multiplied
by a factor of $1 / NRR$. We'll investigate this scenario here. Let's use Senegal as our example.

We'll start by constructing a Leslie matrix for Senegal based on
